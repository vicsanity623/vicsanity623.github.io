## 🎧 New Features (v2.0)

We have completely overhauled the interface to provide a studio-quality experience:

- **🌊 Visual Waveforms**  
  Real-time waveform rendering for every separated track using *WaveSurfer.js*.

- **🎛️ Smart Player**  
  "Solo Mode" playback — clicking play on one stem automatically mutes the others for critical listening.

- **⬇️ Flexible Downloads**  
  Download individual stems (WAV) or grab everything in a single ZIP file.

- **🚀 Real-Time Progress**  
  Live feedback and percentage tracking during the AI separation process.

- **🔓 Seamless Connection**  
  No configuration required. The frontend automatically connects to backend nodes.
