## 🎧 New Features (v2.0)
We have completely overhauled the interface to provide a studio-quality experience:

*   **🌊 Visual Waveforms:** Real-time waveform rendering for every separated track using *WaveSurfer.js*.
*   **🎛️ Smart Player:** "Solo Mode" playback—clicking play on one stem automatically mutes the others for critical listening.
*   **⬇️ Flexible Downloads:** Download individual stems (WAV) or grab everything in a single ZIP file.
*   **🚀 Real-Time Progress:** Live feedback and percentage tracking during the AI separation process.
*   **🔓 Seamless Connection:** No configuration required. The frontend automatically connects to our backend nodes.
